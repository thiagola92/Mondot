# Themes
> I'm not a design! I'm just making some rules for my sanity.  

Decide the follow colors:
- Color 1
	- Background
- Color 2
	- Background for items that have it own background
		- Button, LineEdit
- Color 3
	- Background for items that have it own background and can be focused/hovered
		- Button, LineEdit
- Color 4
	- Background for items that have it own background and can be activated
		- Button
	- Background for the text when selected
		- LineEdit
- Color 5
	- Background for items that have it own background and can be disabled
		- Button, LineEdit
- Color 6
	- Text
		- Uneditable text should have alpha 128 (half of 256)

**Note**: Icons do not follow this rule because can already use color for other thinks (red fail, green success, yellow alert, etc).
