## Should this become a scene?

* If is a window, yes.
  * Doesn't matter the size.
* If is not a container, no.
  * Don't create unnecessary containers to escape this rule.
* If your container doesn't have childs, no.
  * A container alone doesn't need a scene.
* If your container have one child, no.
  * Check if you even need the container.
* Else, maybe
  * Validate yourself if the scope is big/complex enough that needs a scene.
